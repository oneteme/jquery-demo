Hello and welcome to our JQuery Demo.
In here we are gonna go through the needed steps for you to get started with our library and get to writing queries in a faster,easier and more efficient way.

1. Add JQuery Dependency

To get started with JQuery we need to add the JQuery dependency to our project.

```java
// pom.xml

<dependency>
	<groupId>io.github.oneteme</groupId>
	<artifactId>jquery</artifactId>
	<version>4.0.1 /* (The JQuery version we want to use) */</version>
</dependency>

// pom.xml
```
